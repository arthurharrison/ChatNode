### What's it and What's left to do? 
* As I said in the the subtitle, it's a simple group chat where it shows your username and message;
* It would be good to know how many people are in the chat currently and show their name in a sidebar or something, but that would need a 'login' page first and I will develop it when I finish working in the layout, which is a very simple layout.

* Soon I will upload a Image.




### How does it work?
* Sorry, but I will detail it better soon enough.

### What I've learned
* I got to know a new thing about NodeJS, which is Socket.io and I just loved it, but I still need to study more;

* I had the challenge in doing something in CSS and HTML which are things that I am not that comfortable with.
