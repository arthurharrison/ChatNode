  <p  align="center">A Simple Group Chat developed using NodeJS and Socket.io.</p>
</p>

### What's it and What's left to do? 
* As I said in the the subtitle, it's a simple group chat where it shows your username and message;
* It would be good to know how many people are in the chat currently and show their name in a sidebar or something, but that would need a 'login' page first and I will develop it when I finish working in the layout, which is a very simple layout.

The Current version looks like this:

### How does it work?
* You will only need to simply execute the app.js script via NodeJS and you can access it, if you want to execute a simple test with your friends I recommend using [LocalTunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/).

Please feel free to help or to send me some feedback about this repository :)
